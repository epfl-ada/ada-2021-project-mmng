{"quoteID":"2020-03-08-043579","quotation":"where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections -- by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. Italy on Saturday saw its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since the outbreak began in the north of the country on Feb. 21. In its daily update, Italy's civil protection agency said the number of people with the coronavirus rose by 1,247 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the total to 233. There was chaos and confusion in the northern Italian city of Padua in the Veneto region as word spread late Saturday evening that the government was planning to announce the quarantine. Packed bars and restaurants quickly emptied out as many people rushed to the train station in Padua. Travellers with suitcases, wearing face masks, gloves and carrying bottles of sanitizing gel shoved their way on to trains. Before Conte signed the quarantine decree, Stefano Bonaccini, president of the Emilia Romagna region, said parts of the decree were confusing, and he asked the premier for more time to come up with solutions that were more \u00e2 \u20ac \u0153coherent. \u00e2 \u20ac \u009d Around the world, events and festivals have been called off. Travel restrictions and warnings have been issued. A nose-dive in tourist traffic and possible disruptions to supply chains have set off fears of a worldwide economic slowdown. Benchmarks in global markets have gyrated in recent weeks, as hopes for stimulus measures mixed with widespread pessimism on the virus news. Saudi Arabia has banned spectators at any sports competitions starting Saturday. The NBA, as well as British and Japanese sports teams are considering the same, as baseball and soccer seasons are starting. The spread of the virus has also taken a psychological toll. Authorities and manufacturers have been trying to assure panicking consumers they don\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 t need to hoard toilet paper, which have vanished from store shelves in various nations. A particular point of concern are passenger-packed cruise ships, many of which are confronting their own virus problems. Officials in California were deciding Saturday where to dock the Grand Princess cruise ship, after 21 tested positive for the virus. There is evidence the ship now idling off San Francisco was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of almost 20 cases during an earlier voyage. \u00e2 \u20ac \u0153Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined,","speaker":"Mike Pence","date":1583646638000,"numOccurrences":1,"id":"Q24313","party_label":"R"}
