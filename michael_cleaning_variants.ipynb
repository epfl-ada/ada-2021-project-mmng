The whole point of the Belomorkanal, there were no machines allowed. They forced the people to dig with shovels and hoe the whole canal, right? You should see the people writing about their time at the Belomorkanal. There's this one guy, he was a thief from Georgia who had been captured. He was sent to the Belomorkanal to work and in his writing, like `I reject all thievery, I reject that past life.' He said, capitalism made me into this thief, because when there's poor people, there's going to be crime. He said, `I went to the Belomorkanal and I worked.' He became a shock worker, which is what they call the leading workers, people who always met the quota and exceeded the quota... and, like people came from America to work at the Belomorkanal for the Soviet project, the communist project.
